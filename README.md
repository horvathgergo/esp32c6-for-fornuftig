New version of the fan controller is ready to test. A few changes have been made in the current 4.0 version ðŸ˜Ž 

It is based on a pure ESP32-C6 chip that enables to leverage WIFI, Zigbee or Thread.

The previous voltage regulator was also replaced with a better one. The current AP63203WU has higher frequency (>1MHz) and requires cheaper and smaller-sized external components. 

In this version an SR1712F 4-gear 15mm D-shaft rotary switch was attached for manual operation.
